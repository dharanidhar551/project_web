    <p class="break-word">Cellular Jail is one of the most historically significant monuments in the Andaman Islands, as it used to be the place where British officers used to send prisoners for exile, during the period of their rule. The walls of this jail hold many stories of the brave Indian freedom fighters and prisoners who have withstood torment in the cells of this very building. The jail is also referred to as Kala Pani, meaning black water in Hindi, and what was the term for prison cell confinement during that period. The original building was a puce-colored construction and was named "Cellular Jail" on the basis of its architecture. The prison is divided into seven wings which radiate from the main tower into seven different directions. Each of the wings consisted of 693 solitary cells instead of rooms or dormitories. The cells were a mere 4.5 by 2.7 meters with a small ventilator, such that the face of a cell saw the back of the other, making any communication impossible. The construction of the small cells of the jail in itself is an evidence of the cruelty that Indian leaders had to face in order to free this country from the British rule. Due to these small cells, the jail came to be known as Cellular Jail.
The jail is located in Port Blair, which is the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and one of the best towns to visit in the region. To get to Port Blair from India, you will have to take a flight, as it is the only way to reach the Islands.
There are many means of transport to reach the jail from the airport like car, scooter, cab etc..
